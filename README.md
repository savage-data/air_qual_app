Air Quality App for Data from PurpleAir Sensors

I built a simple app for air quality data from PurpleAir Sensors.  This includes a correction for the winter time (only applicable to high inversion areas) and a correction for sensors that display more than a 15% difference between readings (based on EPA regulations).  The app then displays a leaflet map that shows which sensors (in our case, sensors were at schools) were giving dangerous readings.  In our case, we were trying to indicate which schools should consider having recess indoors - hence 'recess' in the title.  Link here: https://savage-data.shinyapps.io/air_qual_app/
